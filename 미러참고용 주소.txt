Making multiplayer games this way is fun & easy. Instead of MonoBehaviour, Mirror provides NetworkBehaviour components with:
▣ [Server] / [Client] tags for server-only / client-only code
▣ [Command] for Client->Server function calls
▣ [ClientRpc] / [TargetRpc] for Server->Client function calls
▣ [SyncVar] / SyncList to automatically sync variables from Server->Client.
